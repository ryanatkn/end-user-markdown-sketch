# End-user markdown sketch

This is a description and proof-of-concept
of a proposed flavor of markdown for end-users on social websites.
The website explains things with demos:
[ryanatkn.github.io/end-user-markdown-sketch](https://ryanatkn.github.io/end-user-markdown-sketch)

[The parser](/src/lib/parse_markdown.ts) was mostly written by ChatGPT o1-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
It's slop.

TODO

- relative links
- more tests
